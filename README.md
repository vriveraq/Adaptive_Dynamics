# Adaptive_Dynamics
In these MATLAB scripts we reproduce some of the figures in the Adaptive Dynamics literature. 

# Goal:
Adaptive Dynamics studies the effect of small changes (mutations) in the population in the long-term. By using the invasion fitness function, we can account for how a rare invader (mutant) can grow in an environment where a species is already at equilibrium. The outcomes can be the preservation of the species, the establishment of the invader, or coexistence. 

Our main goal is to investigate conditions in which coexistence is achieved since this has been shown to have important effects in how disease persists or dies out in an ecological system. 

The code provided here reproduces some of the figures in the Adaptive Dynamics literature were the conditions for coexistence were found.
